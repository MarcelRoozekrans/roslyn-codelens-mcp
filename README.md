## Hosted deployment

A hosted deployment is available on [Fronteir AI](https://fronteir.ai/mcp/marcelroozekrans-roslyn-codelens-mcp).

## Features

- **find_implementations** — Find all classes/structs implementing an interface or extending a class
- **find_callers** — Find every call site for a method, property, or constructor
- **find_event_subscribers** — Every += / -= site for an event symbol, with resolved handler and subscribe/unsubscribe tag
- **find_tests_for_symbol** — List xUnit/NUnit/MSTest methods that exercise a production symbol; opt-in transitive walk through helpers
- **get_test_summary** — Per-project inventory of test methods with framework, attribute kind, data-row count, location, and production symbols referenced
- **find_uncovered_symbols** — Public methods and properties no test transitively reaches; sorted by cyclomatic complexity for prioritization
- **generate_test_skeleton** — Emit a compilable test-class skeleton (as text) for a method or type. Auto-detects xUnit/NUnit/MSTest; surfaces constructor dependencies as TodoNotes; returns a suggested file path. Closes the loop with `find_uncovered_symbols`
- **get_type_hierarchy** — Walk base classes, interfaces, and derived types

- **find_breaking_changes** — Diff the current API against a baseline JSON or DLL; report removed members, kind changes, and accessibility changes with Breaking/NonBreaking severity.
- **find_reflection_usage** — Detect dynamic/reflection-based usage

- **find_large_classes** — Find oversized types by member or line count
- **find_god_objects** — Types combining high size with high cross-namespace coupling; sharper signal than raw size for SRP violations
- **find_unused_symbols** — Dead code detection via reference analysis

- **apply_code_action** — Execute any Roslyn refactoring by title, with preview mode (returns a diff before writing to disk)
- **list_solutions** — List all loaded solutions and which one is currently active
- **set_active_solution** — Switch the active solution by partial name (all subsequent tools operate on it)
- **load_solution** — Load an additional .sln/.slnx at runtime and make it the active solution
- **unload_solution** — Unload a loaded solution to free memory
- **rebuild_solution** — Force a full reload of the analyzed solution
- **analyze_data_flow** — Variable read/write/capture analysis within a statement range (declared, read, written, always assigned, captured, flows in/out)
- **analyze_control_flow** — Branch/loop reachability analysis within a statement range (start/end reachability, return statements, exit points)
- **analyze_change_impact** — Show all files, projects, and call sites affected by changing a symbol — combines find_references and find_callers
- **get_type_overview** — Compound tool: type context + hierarchy + file diagnostics in one call
- **analyze_method** — Compound tool: method signature + callers + outgoing calls in one call
- **get_overloads** — Every overload of a method/constructor (source + metadata) with full parameter and modifier detail in one call
- **get_operators** — Every user-defined operator and conversion operator on a type (source + metadata) with kind, signature, parameters, and source location. Includes synthesized record equality and .NET 7+ checked variants
- **get_call_graph** — Transitive caller/callee graph for a method, depth-bounded with cycle detection
- **get_file_overview** — Compound tool: types defined in a file + file-scoped diagnostics in one call

## External Assemblies

Metadata-origin symbols (from NuGet packages and referenced assemblies) are first-class citizens:

- **Tier 1 — Navigation** (`find_references`, `find_callers`, `find_implementations`): Accepts closed-source type and member names. Resolves them from assembly metadata and reports all source-level usage sites.
- **Tier 2 — Inspection** (`inspect_external_assembly`): Browse namespaces, types, members, and XML doc comments from any referenced assembly without decompiling.
- **Tier 3 — IL** (`peek_il`): Decompile a specific method to annotated ilasm-style IL using ICSharpCode.Decompiler — useful for understanding the internals of NuGet libraries.

Location-returning results include an `Origin` field (`source` or `metadata`) and an `IsGenerated` flag to distinguish hand-written code from closed-source or generated output.

## Security: Trust Model

`get_diagnostics` and `get_code_fixes` can load Roslyn analyzers — DLLs that execute in-process. To prevent untrusted analyzers from running automatically, this server uses a VS/Rider-style trust model:

- **Solutions passed on the CLI at startup** are auto-trusted for the current session.
- **Other solutions** must be explicitly trusted via the `trust_solution` MCP tool.
- **Analyzer DLLs** must come from the user's NuGet global packages folder, the dotnet SDK install dir, or the solution's own `bin`/`obj`. Other paths are skipped.

Use the `list_trusted_paths` and `revoke_trust` tools to inspect and manage trust state. Persistent trust is stored at `%APPDATA%\roslyn-codelens\trust.json`.

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full threat model.

## Quick Start

### VS Code / Visual Studio (via dnx)

Add to your MCP settings (`.vscode/mcp.json` or VS settings):

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "roslyn-codelens": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "dnx",
      "args": ["RoslynCodeLens.Mcp", "--yes"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code Plugin

```bash
claude install gh:MarcelRoozekrans/roslyn-codelens-mcp
```

### .NET Global Tool

```bash
dotnet tool install -g RoslynCodeLens.Mcp
```

Then add to your MCP client config:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "roslyn-codelens": {
      "command": "roslyn-codelens-mcp",
      "args": [],
      "transport": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

The server automatically discovers `.sln` files by walking up from the current directory. You can also pass one or more solution paths directly:

```bash
# Single solution
roslyn-codelens-mcp /path/to/MySolution.sln

# Multiple solutions — switch between them with set_active_solution
roslyn-codelens-mcp /path/to/A.sln /path/to/B.sln
```

When multiple solutions are loaded, use `list_solutions` to see what's available and `set_active_solution("B")` to switch context. The first path is active by default.

## Performance

All type lookups use pre-built reverse inheritance maps, member indexes, and attribute indexes for O(1) access. Benchmarked on an i9-12900HK with .NET 10.0.7:

## Hot Reload

The server watches `.cs`, `.csproj`, `.props`, and `.targets` files for changes. When a change is detected, affected projects are lazily re-compiled on the next tool query — only stale projects and their downstream dependents are re-compiled, not the full solution.

Location-returning tools include an `IsGenerated` flag to distinguish source-generator output from hand-written code.

## Requirements

- .NET 10 SDK
- A .NET solution with compilable projects

## Project compatibility

The server analyses every project that MSBuildWorkspace can load under the .NET SDK runtime.

**Supported:** SDK-style projects (`<Project Sdk="...">`), any target framework — `net48`, `net6.0`, `net8.0`, `net10.0`, etc. .NET Framework targets work fine *as long as the csproj uses the SDK-style format*.

**Skipped (with a warning, not a crash):** legacy non-SDK-style projects (`<Project ToolsVersion="..." xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">`, typically `.NET Framework` projects authored in older versions of Visual Studio). These rely on `Microsoft.Common.props` imports from the .NET Framework MSBuild that ships with Visual Studio, which is not available in the .NET SDK MSBuild runtime.

When a solution contains legacy projects, the server:

1. Loads every SDK-style project normally — all tools work for those.
2. Skips each legacy project and records it in `LoadedSolution.SkippedProjects`.
3. Surfaces the skipped list via `list_solutions` (the `SkippedProjects` array on each `SolutionInfo`) and in the return message of `load_solution`. Each entry includes the project name, kind (`Legacy`), and reason.

**To analyse a legacy project,** convert it to SDK-style format (see [Microsoft's migration guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/porting/project-structure)) or open the solution from a Visual Studio Developer Command Prompt so the full Visual Studio MSBuild is on `PATH`.
